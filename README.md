## What?
A personal and experimental website.
## Why?
This is where I try to waste my time.
## Background?
Originally as an experiment, I decided to expand the website just **because I can**. As I learn, there will be some mistakes, so please do help improve on it.
## Now what?
Here's a list of things to do:
- [] rewrite css and html so it'll be future-friendly
- [] revise the layout of all webpages
- [] flesh out website structure
- [] (consideration only) moving to a markdown-friendly setup?
- [] actually have content
